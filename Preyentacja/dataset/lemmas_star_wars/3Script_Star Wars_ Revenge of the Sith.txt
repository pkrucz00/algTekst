I
personally
the

be

this

bring
a

ANAKIN
I
agree
but
the

may
not
see

PALPATINE
there

time
when

ANAKIN
with

thank
you
my

ANAKIN
at

we
'll
be
able

capture

end

PALPATINE
I
would
worry
about
the
collective
wisdom
of
the
Council
if
they
do
n't
select
you
for
this
assignment
you
be
the
good
choice
by
far
but
they
ca
n't
always
be
trust
to
do
the
right
thing
ANAKIN
they
try
PALPATINE
sit
down
to
his
aide
leave
we
ANAKIN
sit
next
to
PALPATINE
the
Chancellor
lean
over
to
he
PALPATINE
continue
Anakin
you
know
I
be
not
able
to
rely
on
the
Jedi
Council
if
they
have
n't
include
you
in
their
plot
they
soon
will
ANAKIN
I
be
not
sure
I
understand
PALPATINE
you
must
sense
what
I
have
come
to
suspect
the
Jedi
Council
want
control
of
the
Republic
they
be
plan
to
betray
I
ANAKIN
I
do
n't
think
PALPATINE
Anakin
search
your
feeling
you

do
n't
you
ANAKIN
I
know
they
do
n't
trust
you
PALPATINE
or
the
Senate
or
the
Republic
or
democracy
for
that
matter
ANAKIN
I
have
to
admit
my
trust
in
they
have
be
shake
PALPATINE
why
they
ask
you
to
do
something
that
make
you
feel
dishonest
do
n't
they
ANAKIN
do
n't
say
anything
he
simply
look
down
PALPATINE
continue
they
ask
you
to
spy
on
I
do
n't
they
ANAKIN
I
do
n't
know
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
PALPATINE
remember
back
to
your
early
teaching
Anakin
all
those
who
gain
power
be
afraid
to
lose
it
even
the
Jedi
ANAKIN
the
Jedi
use
their
power
for
good
PALPATINE
good
be
a
point
of
view
Anakin
and
the
Jedi
point
of
view
be
not
the
only
valid
one
the
Dark
Lords
of
the
Sith
believe
in
security
and
justice
also
yet
they
be
consider
by
the
Jedi
to
be
ANAKIN
evil
PALPATINE
from
a
Jedi
's
point
of
view
the
Sith
and
the
Jedi
be
similar
in
almost
every
way
include
their
quest
for
great
power
the
difference
between
the
two
be
the
Sith
be
not
afraid
of
the
dark
side
of
the
Force
that
be
why
they
be
more
powerful
ANAKIN
the
Sith
rely
on
their
passion
for
their
strength
they
think
inward
only
about
themselves
PALPATINE
and
the
Jedi
do
n't
ANAKIN
the
Jedi
be
selfless
they
only
care
about
other
PALPATINE
smile
PALPATINE
or
so
you
've
be
train
to
believe
why
be
it
then
that
they
have
ask
you
to
do
something
you
feel
be
wrong
ANAKIN
I
be
not
sure
it
be
wrong
PALPATINE
have
they
ask
you
to
betray
the
Jedi
code
the
Constitution
a
friendship
your
own
value
think
consider
their
motive
keep
your
mind
clear
of
assumption
the
fear
of
lose
power
be
a
weakness
of
both
the
Jedi
and
the
Sith
ANAKIN
be
deep
in
thought
PALPATINE
continue
do
you
ever
hear
the
tragedy
of
Darth
Plagueis
the
wise
ANAKIN
no
PALPATINE
I
think
not
it
be
not
a
story
the
Jedi
would
tell
you
it
be
a
Sith
legend
Darth
Plagueis
be
a
Dark
Lord
of
the
Sith
so
powerful
and
so
wise
he
could
use
the
Force
to
influence
the
midi
chlorian
to
create
life
he
have
such
a
knowledge
of
the
dark
side
that
he
could
even
keep
the
one
he
care
about
from
die
ANAKIN
he
could
actually
save
people
from
death
PALPATINE
the
dark
side
of
the
Force
be
a
pathway
to
many
ability
some
consider
to
be
unnatural
ANAKIN
what
happen
to
he
PALPATINE
he
become
so
powerful
the
only
thing
he
be
afraid
of
be
lose
his
power
which
eventually
of
course
he
do
unfortunately
he
teach
his
apprentice
everything
he
know
then
his
apprentice
kill
he
in
his
sleep
smile
Plagueis
never
see
it
come
it
be
ironic
he
could
save
other
from
death
but
not
himself
ANAKIN
be
it
possible
to
learn
this
power

from
