be
the
more
I

about

the
bad
I

I
would
feel
well
if
I
think
about
the

the

it
shimmer
in

the

the

always
smell
of

well
tell
I
do
you
dream
of
power
and
politic
when
you
be
a
little

PADM
laugh
no
that
be
the
last
thing
I
think
of
my
dream
be
to
help
in
the
Refugee
Relief
Movement
I
never
think
of
run
for
elect
office
but
the
more
history
I
study
the
more
I
realise
how
much
good
politician
could
do
so
when
I
be
eight
I
join
the
Apprentice
legislator
then
later
on
become
a
senatorial
advisor
with
such
a
passion
that
before
I
know
it
I
be
elect
Queen
partly
because
I
score
so
high
on
my
education
certificate
but
for
the
most
part
it
be
my
conviction
that
reform
be
possible
I
be
n't
the
young
Queen
ever
elect
but
now
that
I
think
back
on
it
I
be
not
sure
I
be
old
enough
I
be
not
sure
I
be
ready
ANAKIN
the
people
you
serve
think
you
do
a
good
job
I
hear
they
try
to
amend
the
Constitution
so
you
could
stay
in
office
PADM
Popular
rule
be
not
democracy
Annie
it
give
the
people
what
they
want
not
what
they
need
and
truthfully
I
be
relieve
when
my
two
term
be
up
so
be
my
parent
they
worry
about
I
during
the
blockade
and
could
n't
wait
for
it
all
to
be
over
actually
I
be
hope
to
have
a
family
by
now
my
sister
have
the
most
amazing
wonderful
kid
but
when
the
Queen
ask
I
to
serve
as
Senator
I
could
n't
refuse
she
ANAKIN
I
agree
I
think
the

need
you
I
be
glad
you
choose

I
feel
thing
be
go
to
happen
in
our
generation
that
will
change
the
galaxy

profound

thank
you
your
Highness
I
only
Wish
I
could
have
serve
you
well
by
stay
on
Coruscant
for
the
vote
SIO
BIBBLE
give
the
circumstance
Senator
you
know
it
be
the
only
decision
her
Highness
could
have
make
QUEEN
JAMILLIA
how
many
system
have
join
Count
Dooku
and
the
separatist
PADM
about
two
hundred
and
more
be
leave
the
Republic
every
day
if
the
Senate
vote
to
create
an
army
I
be
sure
it
be
go
to
push
we
into
a
civil
war
SIO
BIBBLE
it
be
unthinkable
there
have
n't
be
a
full
scale
war
since
the
formation
of
the
Republic
QUEEN
JAMILLIA
do
you
see
any
way
through
negotiation
to
bring
the
separatist
back
into
the
Republic
PADM
not
if
they
feel
threatened
the
separatist
do
n't
have
an
army
but
if
they
be
provoke
they
will
move
to
defend
themselves
I
be
sure
of
that
and
with
no
time
or
money
to
build
an
army
my
guess
be
they
will
turn
to
the
Commerce
Guilds
or
the
Trade
Federation
for
help
QUEEN
JAMILLIA
the
army
of
commerce
why
have
nothing
be
do
in
the
Senate
to
restrain
they
PADM
I
be
afraid
that
despite
the
Chancellor
's
good
effort
there
be
still
many
bureaucrat
judge
and
even
senator
on
the
payroll
of
the
Guilds
SIO
BIBBLE
it
be
outrageous
after
all
of
those
hearing
and
the
four
trial
in
the
Supreme
Court
Nute
Gunray
be
still
the
Viceroy
of
the
Trade
Federation
do
those
money
monger
control
everything
QUEEN
JAMILLIA
Remember
Counsellor
the
court
be
able
to
reduce
the
Federation
's
army
that
be
a
move
in
the
right
direction
PADM
there
be
rumour
your
Highness
that
the
Federation
Army
be
not
reduce
as
they
be
order
ANAKIN
the
Jedi
have
not
be
allow
to
investigate
it
would
be
to
be
too
dangerous
for
the
economy
we
be
tell
QUEEN
JAMILLIA
we
must
keep
our
faith
in
the
Republic
the
day
we
stop
believe
democracy
can
work
be
the
day
we
lose
it
PADM
let
's
pray
that
day
never
come
QUEEN
JAMILLIA
in
the
meantime
we
must
consider
your
own
safety
sio

this

I

his
knowledge

be
unique
in

I
think
he
leave

he
lose
faith
in
the

he
believe
that
politic
be
corrupt
and
he
feel
the
Jedi
betray
themselves
by
serve
the
politician
he
always
have
very
high
expectation
of

he
disappear
